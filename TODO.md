# TODO: Lists for Preliminary Study

## Small tasks
> week7: 04/04 - 08/04
- [x] Learned how DDPG works (read, write, implement)
- [x] Learned how TD3 works (read, write, implement)
- [x] Learned how SAC works (read, write, implement)
- [x] Find what is a solution in pyribs
- [x] Run a couple of basic scenarios on Lunar Lander

> week8: 11/04 - 15/04
- [x] Make a Gantt Chart
- [x] Read the QD paper on CMAP-Elites
- [x] Check 'colas2020scaling' which uses QD for fault-tolerant robot control.
- [x] Adapt PD-ERL for LunarLander (continuous)
- [x] Test QD learned polices on damaged lunar lander. It is very interesting to see how well they perform before any online learning.
- [x] Find out what the batch_size is in QD

> week9: 16/04 - 22/04
- [x] Make table for overview of ERL, DRL and QD.
- [x] <s> Find out how to make a NN policy in pyribs</s> - NOT REELVANT 
 

> week10: 02/05 - 06/05
- [x] Improve general fault-tolerant control diagram
- [x] Finish PD-ERL diagram
- [x] Finish writing about DL

> week11: 09/05 - 14/05
- [x] Write about ERL: figure, pseudocode, results
- [x] Write the ERL sota:
    - [x] comparing table from the review paper
    - [x] explanations
    - [x] motivate decision
- [x] Make nice plotting functions
- [x] Wrap LunarLander in a global env


> week12: 16/05 - 20/05
- [x] Test on LunarLander with faulty state measurement
- [x] Finish writing about PDERL: 
  - [x] figure
  - [x] tricks
  - [x] results


> week12: 23/05 - 27/05
- [ ] Rerun archive map on LunarLander Nominal
- [ ] Explain the testing environment
- [ ] Write DRL in flight Control
- [ ] 
<!-- % \item Code a simple combination between QD and a ERL framework (most probably PD-ERL) -->
## Report Writing:
- [x] Novelty search and QD intro
- [x] Prepare nice diagram
- [x] Background on FT
- [x] Background on RL
- [x] SOTA DRL
- [x] SOTA ERL

# Ideas
 - Test fewer envs. and papers for the lit study
 - Wrap PH-Lab model in a gym-like global environment 


# Things to check later
- Try MPI from OpenAI https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/utils/mpi.html
