# TODO: Lists for Preliminary Study

## Small tasks
> week7: 04/04 - 08/04
- [x] Learned how DDPG works (read, write, implement)
- [ ] Learned how TD3 works (read, write, implement)
- [ ] Learned how SAC works (read, write, implement)
- [x] Find what is a solution in pyribs
- [x] Run a couple of basic scenarios on Lunar Lander
- [ ] Read the QD paper on CMAP-Elites
- [x] Check 'colas2020scaling' which uses QD for fault-tolerant robot control.
- [x] Adapt PD-ERL for lunar lander
- [ ] Test QD learned polices on damaged lunar lander. It is very interesting to see how well they perform before any online learning.
- [x] Make a Gantt Chart


<!-- % \item Code a simple combination between QD and a ERL framework (most probably PD-ERL) -->
## Report Writing:
- [x] Novelty search and QD intro
- [ ] Prepare nice diagram
- [ ] Background on FT
- [ ] Background on RL
- 

# Ideas
 - Test fewer envs. and papers for the lit study
 - 



# Things to check later
- still not sure how actor-critic frameworks should be implemented
- Try MPI from OpenAI https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/utils/mpi.html
